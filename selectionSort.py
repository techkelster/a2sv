The code you provided is an implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in Python, but there is a small issue in the select method. The issue is with the way you are trying to find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array. You are using i as the loop control variable, which is intended to be used as the start of the unsorted part, and it shouldn't be modified inside the loop.

You can fix this by keeping track of the index of the minimum element separately. Here's the corrected code:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def select(self, arr, i):
        # Initialize the index of the minimum element to the current element
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        return min_index

    def selectionSort(self, arr, n):
        for i in range(n - 1):
            min_index = self.select(arr, i)
            if i != min_index:
                arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
